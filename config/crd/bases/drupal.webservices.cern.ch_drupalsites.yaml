                    not apply to all instances of a given Kind. \n Conditions should
                    be added to explicitly convey properties that users and components
                    care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                    from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition
                    can not be changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and
                    has the same backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of
                    any other part of the API."
